# CSC-220-Final-Project-Code
This code was for an assignment in my CSC 220 class at LA Tech. 
It was made in collaboration with my classmate, Andrew Almond

The goal was to make a library management system capable of several requirements. 
The requirements included having at least three different data structures, being able to look  up books, look up authors,
see which books are checked out, check out books, check in books, and, in case of an emergency, which books to rescue in what order. 

To use this program, you will also need a txt file with a few details about the books inside.
The txt file should be formatted as so,

Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, Tolkien, 0, 2
Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, AdamsD, 0, 1
Ender's Game, Card, 0, 6
Dune Chronicles, Herbert, 1, 27
Song Of Ice And Fire Series, Martin, 1, 54

having 
Book name, author, checked in/out (1 or 0), and the importance of the book
